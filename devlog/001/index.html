    <section class="content">
        <p class="text">As you grow older and continue to pursue a specific passion you start to realize your strengths, weakness, and you
            become more aware of what your personality is like. I’ve made my attempt to be a jack of all trades, with varying
            degrees of success. The social media personality formerly known as “Kudanaman”, while a hit nickname amongst
            my peers, never garnered the millions of followers I desired. My previous aliases had similar degrees of success
            (Random News Guy could never seem to compete with iCarly), and so I got older and kept experimenting, finding
            out who I was and what I wanted to become.</p>
        <p class="text">I realized the person that I wanted to become wasn’t a celebrity renowned for their outlandish personality. I wanted
            to be known as a master of my craft, finesse over fame, technical skillset over social skills. So in 2017, I
            made steps to move away from easy work that only came with the satisfaction of showing off to my friends, and
            moved towards creatively satisfying, mentally challenging work. It’s been a good experience so far, making an
            Android App was great. Still, it wasn’t a good representation of my capabilities, my level of interest in the
            field of Computer Science, or my dedication. My projects were lacking complexity, efficiency, feedback and iteration.
            I wished to let those four words define my projects for 2018, therefore I took on a research project on machine
            learning (which did pretty well for the time dedicated to it). Even got some unique attention and I made what
            I believe to be an important contact. There are so many goals that I have for this year, becoming a certified
            Java and Android programmer, developing my research project, dedicating myself to completing a game. All these
            goals that I have are in an effort to make myself real, gain some real credible skill. Not just the recognition
            for making a first step before anyone else, being recognized for what I’m making progress in, not that I’m attempting
            to make progress.</p>

        <p class="text">All leading up to of course the big goal. Yes I want to make myself credible and skilled, but I also am extremely
            ambitious. I want to go to the most prestigious universities imaginable, and so I want to stand out amongst the
            flood of driven students who are making substantial change in the world. Unlike some of the other students in
            other countries, there isn’t a Computer Science community present in my nation (Zimbabwe) to utilize. The benefit
            of such a community is that it gives you an affordable means to learn and develop your skills. So I tried turning
            to the international community to try to “expand my mind”.</p>

        <p class="text">Unfortunately, mind expansion calls for wallet depletion of about $6k in USD (which is far from a commodity here).</p>

        <p class="text">Which leaves me where I am now. This development log (devlog) exists to document, analyze and review my projects.
            To keep myself honest, ensure that I keep programming and improving continuously, ensuring that I don’t stagnate.
            To write about my unique thoughts while I’m working on something, the thoughts which are consistently lost the
            moment I move on to the next month, week or day. To be able to create an accurate post-mortem and investigate
            the successes and failures of a project with depth. I’ll geek here. Things will get technical, things will get
            stupid, things will get weird, and there will be memes. But this is for me. For the odd individual who may be
            interested in what goes on in my mind and may consistently enjoy these devlogs, welcome! This thing is going
            to change, and I’m going to come to find my writing style. Failures will happen, and lots of them.</p>
        <p class="text">But the goal of this devlog, these projects, and all this code is to improve and grow. Growth was never supposed
            to be beautiful.</p>
