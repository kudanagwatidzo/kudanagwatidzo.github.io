            <p class="text">The sharing of programs in computer systems is becoming more widespread, so
                although we might expect to be using a large fraction of the algorithms in this book, we
                also might expect to have to implement only a small fraction of them. For example, the
                Java libraries contain implementations of a host of fundamental algorithms. However,
                implementing simple versions of basic algorithms helps us to understand them better
                and thus to more effectively use and tune advanced versions from a library. More
                important, the opportunity to reimplement basic algorithms arises frequently. The primary
                reason to do so is that we are faced, all too often, with completely new computing
                environments (hardware and software) with new features that old implementations
                may not use to best advantage. In this book, we concentrate on the simplest reasonable
                implementations of the best algorithms. We do pay careful attention to coding the critical
                parts of the algorithms, and take pains to note where low-level optimization effort
                could be most beneficial.</p>
            <p class="quote">"When we use a computer to help us solve a problem, we typically are faced with a
                number of possible approaches. For small problems, it hardly matters which approach
                we use, as long as we have one that correctly solves the problem. For huge problems (or
                applications where we need to solve huge numbers of small problems), however, we
                quickly become motivated to devise methods that use time and space efficiently."</p>
