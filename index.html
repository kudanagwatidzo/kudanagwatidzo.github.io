              The app I created for St John's College's annual "Spring Fair" event. The Spring Fair app is your tool for the easiest fair experience possible! An amazing way to enjoy the annual event, the Spring Fair app ensures that you never miss an amazing event, always find the store with the item you need, and never get lost in the large area of the fair.

          My name is Kudana Gwatidzo, and I'm a 16 year old student at St John's College. I love programming, at this time specifically I'm intrested in the capabilites of virtual reality, artifical intelligence and machine learning. When my eyes aren't glued to a screen coding, I'm glued to a screen watching and analyzing film and television. I love theatre and looking at politics, being an active member of debating and MUN societies. You can email me if you want to collaborate or ask any other questions. <address><a href="mailto:kudanagwatidzo@gmail.com">kudanagwatidzo@gmail.com</a></address>
