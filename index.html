          an amazing event, always find the store with the item you need, and never get lost in the large area of the fair.

        I am a student and programmer with a globally refined approach to problem solving. Trained in industry standard languages such as Microsoft's C# and Java, 
        in addition to having skills in repository management with Git and web services with AWS and a solid foundation in data science and 
        machine learning algorithms, I am a software engineer who practices industry standard techniques while developing my personal machine 
        learning research project, which aims to study what applications of AI in videos games are. My ability to apply my technical skills to 
        real world situations as well was built off of my time as a Junior Parliamentarian for Zimbabwe's government and my international 
        debate experience, where I have been granted the title of best debater in Africa. Leading my high school as Deputy Headboy, pursuing 
        the limits of science in the third world and pushing my limits as I pursue continued excellence as GPA salutatorian, I stand as a 
        professional worker with a unique, global insight.

        My name is Kudana Gwatidzo, and I'm a 17 year old student at St John's College. I love programming, at this time specifically
        I'm intrested in the capabilites of virtual reality, artifical intelligence and machine learning. When my eyes aren't
        glued to a screen coding, I'm glued to a screen watching and analyzing film and television. I love theatre and looking
        at politics, being an active member of debating and MUN societies. You can email me if you want to collaborate or
        ask any other questions.
